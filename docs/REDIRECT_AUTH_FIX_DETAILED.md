# Redirect Authentication Fix

## Problem
The redirect authentication was working (user was being redirected and returning to the app), but when the user returned to the app, the logs showed no firebaseUser was detected, whereas popup sign-in worked fine.

## Root Cause
The issue was a timing problem between the redirect result handler and the `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The redirect result was being processed correctly, but there was a race condition where:

1. `handleRedirectResult` would find the user from the redirect
2. But `onAuthStateChanged` wasn't firing or wasn't finding the Firebase user
3. This caused the app to not recognize the authenticated user

## Solution

### 1. Improved Redirect Detection
Added utility functions to better detect when we're in a redirect flow:

```typescript
export const isInRedirectFlow = (): boolean => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return false;
  
  const url = window.location.href;
  const hasRedirectParams = url.includes('code=') || 
                           url.includes('state=') || 
                           url.includes('access_token') ||
                           url.includes('id_token');
  
  const hasFirebaseParams = url.includes('apiKey=') || 
                           url.includes('oobCode=') ||
                           url.includes('continueUrl=');
  
  return hasRedirectParams || hasFirebaseParams;
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Redirect Result Handler
Improved the `handleRedirectResult` function to:
- Detect redirect flows more accurately
- Wait longer for auth state to settle during redirects
- Add a `waitForAuthReady` utility to ensure `auth.currentUser` is properly set
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. Restructured Auth Initialization
Fixed the AuthContext initialization to:
- Set up the `onAuthStateChanged` listener first
- Then check for redirect results
- Use a processing flag to prevent race conditions
- Better coordination between redirect handling and auth state changes

### 4. Race Condition Prevention
Added a `processingRedirect` state to prevent the auth state listener from making premature decisions while a redirect is still being processed.

## Key Changes

### auth-utils.ts
- Added `isInRedirectFlow()` utility
- Added `waitForAuthReady()` utility
- Enhanced `handleRedirectResult()` with better timing and error handling

### AuthContext.tsx
- Restructured initialization to set up listener first
- Added `processingRedirect` state management
- Improved Google provider configuration with error handling
- Better coordination between redirect and auth state handling

## Testing
A test page was created at `/auth-test` to verify:
1. Both popup and redirect authentication work
2. Firebase user is properly detected after redirect
3. Auth state is correctly synchronized
4. Console logs provide clear debugging information

## Expected Behavior
After this fix:
1. Mobile/tablet users will use redirect authentication
2. Desktop users will try popup first, fallback to redirect
3. After redirect completion, both `user` and `firebaseUser` should be populated
4. Auth state should be consistent between popup and redirect flows
5. Console logs should clearly show the authentication flow

## Debugging
If issues persist, check:
1. Console logs for redirect flow detection
2. Firebase configuration (API keys, authorized domains)
3. Browser storage permissions
4. Network connectivity during redirect
5. URL parameters after redirect completion
