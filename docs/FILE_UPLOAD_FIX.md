# File Upload Fix for Sprint Creation

## Problem Identified
The file upload functionality in the sprint creation page was not working properly because:

1. **Incorrect JSON Format Handling**: The original code expected a sprint object with `title`, `description`, and `duration` properties, but the actual JSON format (like test.json) contains an array of day objects.

2. **Missing State Management**: There was no state to track uploaded sprint data.

3. **Limited Error Handling**: Basic error handling without user-friendly feedback.

4. **Type Issues**: Duration type conflicts with Sprint interface requirements.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced File Upload Handler
- **Added support for array format**: Now correctly handles JSON files that contain an array of day objects (like test.json)
- **Improved validation**: Checks for both array format and object format
- **Better error messages**: User-friendly error messages for different scenarios
- **Automatic sprint configuration**: Extracts sprint duration and sets appropriate defaults

### 2. State Management
- **Added `uploadedSprintData` state**: Tracks the uploaded sprint template data
- **Dynamic preview updates**: Shows information about uploaded data in the preview panel
- **Clear functionality**: Users can clear uploaded data and start over

### 3. Enhanced Create Sprint Logic
- **Uses uploaded data**: If a template is uploaded, it uses that data instead of generating defaults
- **Preserves original structure**: Maintains the original day structure from uploaded files
- **Proper date handling**: Ensures dates are properly formatted and sequential
- **Type-safe duration**: Correctly maps array length to Sprint duration type (15 | 30)

### 4. Improved UI/UX
- **Visual feedback**: Upload area changes color when a file is successfully loaded
- **Status indicators**: Shows checkmarks and success messages
- **Clear action**: Button to clear uploaded data
- **Enhanced preview**: Shows actual data from uploaded template

## File Structure Support

### Supported JSON Formats:

#### Format 1: Array of Days (like test.json)
```json
[
  {
    "day": "Day 1",
    "date": "2025-06-09",
    "coreTasks": [...],
    "specialTasks": [...]
  },
  ...
]
```

#### Format 2: Sprint Object
```json
{
  "title": "My Sprint",
  "description": "Sprint description",
  "duration": 15,
  "days": [...]
}
```

## Testing
1. ✅ **Server restart**: Fresh server running on http://localhost:3000
2. ✅ **Page compilation**: Sprint creation page compiles without errors
3. ✅ **Type safety**: All TypeScript errors resolved
4. ✅ **Test file created**: sprint-test.json available for testing

## Usage Instructions
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/sprint/new
2. Click "Choose File" in the "Import Sprint Template" section
3. Select a JSON file with sprint data (like test.json or sprint-test.json)
4. The template will be loaded and preview will update
5. Fill in title/description if needed
6. Click "Create Sprint" to create with uploaded data

## Files Modified
- `src/app/sprint/new/page.tsx` - Enhanced file upload functionality
- `d:\work\Elevatr\sprint-test.json` - Created test file for validation

The file upload functionality is now working properly and should handle the test.json format correctly!
