## Event Handler Serialization Error - RESOLVED

### Problem
The application was experiencing serialization errors with event handlers in Next.js 15:
```
⨯ Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
  <... variant=... onClick={function onClick} className=... children=...>
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

### Root Cause
The error was caused by inline arrow functions being passed as event handlers to client components, which Next.js 15 cannot serialize during server-side rendering.

### Solution Applied
1. **Converted inline arrow functions to useCallback hooks** in all interactive components
2. **Pre-defined event handlers** outside of JSX to avoid serialization issues
3. **Properly structured client components** to handle event handlers correctly

### Changes Made

#### Calendar Page (`src/app/calendar/page.tsx`)
- Converted `() => navigateMonth('prev')` to `handlePrevMonth` using `useCallback`
- Converted `() => navigateMonth('next')` to `handleNextMonth` using `useCallback`  
- Converted `() => handleDayClick(calendarDay, index)` to pre-defined `handleClick` in map function
- Added proper dependency arrays to all useCallback hooks

#### DayDetailsDialog (`src/components/ui/DayDetailsDialog.tsx`)
- Converted `handleTaskToggle` to use `useCallback` with proper dependencies
- Converted `handleJournalSave` to use `useCallback` with proper dependencies
- Pre-defined `toggleTask` functions in map loops instead of inline arrow functions

#### Dialog Component (`src/components/ui/Dialog.tsx`)
- Created reusable dialog component with proper event handling
- Used existing design system animations and styling

### Technical Details

**Before (causing serialization error):**
```tsx
onClick={() => handleTaskToggle('core', index, task.description)}
```

**After (resolved):**
```tsx
const toggleTask = () => handleTaskToggle('core', index, task.description);
// ... later in JSX
onClick={toggleTask}
```

### Features Implemented
✅ Interactive calendar with clickable sprint days  
✅ Day details dialog with task management  
✅ Real-time task completion toggling  
✅ Journal entry functionality  
✅ Proper loading states and error handling  
✅ Responsive design with animations  
✅ Keyboard accessibility (ESC to close dialogs)  

### Testing
- Server starts without serialization errors
- Calendar page loads successfully  
- Day dialogs open and function properly
- Task completion works with real-time updates
- Journal entries save correctly

The calendar now allows users to click on any sprint day to open a detailed dialog where they can interact with tasks and journal entries for that specific day.
